/* flexbox is not just a single CSS property but a whole toolbox of properties that you can use to put things where you need them. Some of these properties belong on the flex container, while some go on the flex items. This is a simple yet important concept. */

/* A flex container is any element that has display: flex on it. A flex item is any element that lives directly inside of a flex container. */

/* .container {
    border: 5px solid #ffcc5c;
    display: flex;
  } */

.container {
    border: 5px solid #ffcc5c;
    display: flex;
}

/* ---------------- */

/* Somewhat confusingly, any element can be both a flex container and a flex item. Said another way, you can also put display: flex on a flex item and then use flexbox to arrange its children.
E.g.
.container {
    background: lightblue;
    padding: 16px;
    border: 4px solid blue;
    gap: 8px;
    display: flex;
}
.item {
    background: peachpuff;
    border: 4px solid salmon;
    height: 48px;
    flex: 1;
    padding: 4px;
} */
